# A 'Find Waldo' Type App

Using React and Firebase as the backend, I created a "Find Waldo" application.


## Goal

Tie in everything I have learned so far in the React section of The Odin Project and try using Firebase as a backend to tie into the front-end functionality of the application.

## Review

Had some difficulty figuring out how to trigger the tagging feature of the application. Overall, the experience building this was enjoyable and challenging.
